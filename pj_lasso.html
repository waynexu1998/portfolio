                <h2 class="desc">Lasso is short for Logistics And Student Staff Organizer. Just like its name, it is designed to manage student staff's work progress and schedule. The lasso platform was established in 2008 and has not been updated since then. My colleague Gaetan and I came up with a fresh idea to give this platform a facelift. The original platform was a very important piece of tool for the Rettner Media Lab workspace, not only it provides straight forward management solutions but also makes it easy enough for student staff to service customers. My goal is to create a new platform that builds on the originla feature set and provides better UI/UX.</h2>
